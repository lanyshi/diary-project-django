# Project Blog

For this project, I'm going to create a diary web application using Django framework by following one of Django Girls' tutorials.

* Source code can be found at [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_start_project/).

* My operating system: macOS

## Create Project Space

Create a project workspace, called *project-workspace* which holds my project content.

Load python3 and activate virtual environment.

Go to *project-workspace* and run the following command line in terminal.

'''
django-admin startproject my-project .
'''
